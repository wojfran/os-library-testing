Atreus: Father… why are we doing this now?

Kratos: I need to know you can survive the journey.

Atreus: Then we leave for the mountain?

Kratos: Depends on you. Hunt.

Kratos: What did you find?

Atreus: Tracks. Not deer though. I keep looking.

Kratos: Boy. You miss these.

Atreus: Huh… Close, but also not deer. See? Tips are too wide. Mountain goat?

Kratos: You mother taught you well.

Atreus: Yeah… I’ll see what’s up ahead.

Kratos: More tracks?

Atreus: Yeah. But they’re too round. Could be a wild boar.

Kratos: Good.

[Atreus sees a fallen bridge.]

Atreus: Oop. Now what?

[Kratos easily jumps over the fall bridge.]

Kratos: This way, boy.

Atreus: Hup! Oh. Wait. Deer tracks. They’re fresh. This way.

[He runs forward and unexpectedly stumbles upon a huge deer.]

Atreus: Aaah! Found it.

Kratos: Slow down, boy!

Atreus: Sorry…

Kratos: You are hunting dear - not chasing it.

Atreus: Yes, father.

[A huge deer with big winding horns appears in their way. Frightened of uninvited guests, he runs away, destroying the small bridge with his massive hooves.]

Atreus: He broke our bridge… how are we gonna get across?

Kratos: Step aside.

[Kratos takes his axe, Leviathan, in his mighty hands and throws it to the barrier. When it breaks the axe returns to Kratos’s hand.]

Atreus: Wow.

Kratos: Go.

Atreus: Woah. What happened here? There it is!

Kratos: HOLD.

[Despite the outcry of his father Atreus shoots and misses.]

Kratos: (screaming) What are you doing? Now its guard is up! Only fire… (deep breath) Only fire when I tell you to fire.

Atreus: I’m sorry…

Kratos: Do not be sorry. Be better. Find it. (Atreus tries to take back his bow, but Kratos doesn’t let him) Find. It.

[They stumble upon zombie-like creatures.]

Atreus: Ahh! My bow!

Kratos: No! You are not ready - stay back!

Atreus: Father! Above you! Watch your right!

[Kratos destroys the dead using the inhuman strength of his fists and his magical axe that freezes enemies.]

Atreus: Draugr? They’ve never come this close to our woods before.

Kratos: Keep moving.

Atreus: Uh… deer’s this way. I can see more tracks… or we can follow you.

[They descend into a small cave by a chain attached to a stone.]

Atreus: Wolves!

[Kratos smashes them to death with bare hands.]

Atreus: They were just hungry.

Kratos: What?

Atreus: The wolves. They weren’t mean. They were starving.

Kratos: Yes. I imagine they were.

[He opens a nearby tomb and takes a few coins from there.]

Atreus: What - ?

Kratos: He can no longer use it. We can.

[They continue the journey.]

Atreus: (to himself) Are we lost? Nah… Should we be in here?

[Atreus notes that the deer jumped over the dilapidated wall of the old temple…]

Atreus: Up there! He went in the old temple. But Mom told me never to go in there.

Kratos: We do what we please, boy. No excuses.

[He opens a massive wooden door.]

Atreus: Look.

[He notices the deer. It stands at a fairly small distance from the characters, but it is impossible to get closer.]

Atreus: Can I have my bow back now?

Kratos: Can you hit it from here?

Atreus: We should get closer.

[They go around, trying to get closer to the deer.]

Atreus: I went hunting with mother a bunch of times. You never wanted to take me. Why now?

Kratos: It was her wish. And… it was time.

Atreus: Ok. Draugr!

[Kratos breaks through their skulls.]

Atreus: Something’s gotta open that gate… It’s opening. You froze it in place. Clever.

Kratos: Follow me, Atreus.

Atreus: Sooo… Nice. Where you going? I think he’s this way.

[In the far corner of a small cave, Atreus notices a skillfully made plaque on which a story from northern legends is drawn. The plaque is closed with two shutters.]

Atreus: Oh look, it’s Skoll & Hati – the giant wolves who chase the sun and moon. Where did they come from? How did they get up there? What’s happening there at the end? They eat the sun and moon and then everybody fights?

[After a short wander, Kratos and Atreus find the deer again. Atreus is preparing to shoot an innocent creature for the first time.]

Kratos: Wait for my mark… Relax. Do not think of it as an animal. It is simply a target. Clear your mind. (inhaled breath) Steady your aim and breathe in. Exhale and release.

Atreus: I got it.

Kratos: Good.

Atreus: It’s… it’s still alive.

Kratos: Your knife… No. Finish what you started.

Atreus: I can’t…

[Kratos clutching his hand with a knife in his hand. Together they finish the animal.]

Atreus: I…

[Suddenly a giant troll attacks them. There’s a piece of stone column in his hands, and fire and rage in his eyes.]

Kratos: Atreus!

Atreus: We’re going to fight that?!?

Kratos: We have no choice.

Atreus: Miss! Okay - just tell as when to shoot! WHOA! Watch your right! Sorry can’t. Nista! Watch ‘em! Tell me when… He’s too strong! We keep hitting him! Why isn’t he falling?

Kratos: Get back, boy.

Atreus: Fall, dammit! FALL! Ready and waning. Watch out Father! Sorry, not ready. Ready.

Kratos: Get control of yourself, boy!

Atreus: I’m FINE. Kill it!

[Kratos kills the troll by ripping his skull apart. Atreus runs up to the corpse and begins to stab him furiously and scream.]

Atreus: RAAAA! That’s what you get.

Kratos: Boy.

Atreus: (to the troll) Think I’m afraid of you?! You’re nothing to me!

Kratos: BOY!

Atreus: NOTHING!

Kratos: Look at me! Look at me, boy!

Atreus: NOTHING!

Kratos: Boy – look at me!

Atreus: We DID it.

Kratos: You are not ready.

Atreus: What? Are you serious? I found the deer. I proved myself. How am I not ready?

Kratos: We are going home.

Atreus: I haven’t been sick in a long time. I can do this.

Kratos: You are NOT ready.

Atreus: I AM ready.

Kratos: Do not speak again.

Atreus: The path home is this way. Duh.

[Kratos is about to return home.]

Atreus: Still can’t get the doors open, huh?

Kratos: Quiet.

Atreus: What is THAT thing? I told you something was different about the forest.

Kratos: And I told you do not to speak.

Atreus: But why would a Fire Troll burn mother’s garden? And since when are Draugr so close to the house? And what was that frozen thing that attacked us?

Kratos: I do not know. Now be silent, we are almost home. Inside, boy.

[Soon they're going back to their cabin.]

Atreus: It’s not fair. He doesn’t know anything…

Kratos: You lost control.

Atreus: That thing was trying to kill us. It’s not like you don’t get angry in a fight.

Kratos: Anger can be a weapon if you control it – use it. You clearly cannot. When you lose…

Atreus: I haven’t been sick in a long time. I’m better now.

Kratos: Fine. (puts his hands in front of him) Come on then.

Atreus: You want me to hit you?

Kratos: I want you to try.

Atreus: OWWW! What are you - ?

Kratos: Try again.

Atreus: Why are you doing that?

Kratos: Too slow. Try again.

Atreus: Cut it out!

Kratos: Weak. Again. Again.

Atreus: STOP IT!

Kratos: AGAIN.

Atreus: (slight cough)

Kratos: Your anger… you can get lost in it. The path ahead is difficult and you, Atreus, are clearly not ready.

[Someone's knocking on their door.]

Atreus: What was that?

Kratos: QUIET.

The Stranger
[There's a slightly cocky, confident voice coming from behind the door.]

The Stranger: Come on out! It’s no use hiding anymore. I know who you are...

Atreus: What’s going on? Do you know him?

The Stranger: ...more importantly I know what you are!

Kratos: Boy. Beneath the floor. Now…

Atreus: But… you told me never to go down there. Who is that?

Kratos: I do not know.

Atreus: What’s he talking about?

Kratos: I do not know. Get IN.

The Stranger: Just tell me what I want to know! No need for this to get bloody.

[Kratos comes out of the cabin. He is met by a lean man with a light-brown beard. The man wears almost no clothes - only light pants. His body is covered in blue tattoos.]

The Stranger: Thought you’d be bigger. But you’re definitely the one. Long way from home, aren’t you?

Kratos: What do you want?

The Stranger: Oh, you already know the answer to that.

Kratos: Whatever it is you seek I do not have it. You should move on.

The Stranger: Hahaha. And here I thought your kind was supposed to be so enlightened. So much better than us. So much smarter. And yet you hide out here in the woods - like a coward.

Kratos: You do not want this fight.

The Stranger: Oh… I’m pretty sure I do. (hits Kratos)

Kratos: Leave… my… home.

The Stranger: You are going to have to kill me for that to happen. (hits Kratos again)

[He punches Kratos in the face several times. Kratos intercepts the last blow.]

Kratos: I warned you -

The Stranger: Finally.

[Kratos strikes a powerful blow to the Stranger's face.]

The Stranger: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Kratos: You would not listen.

The Stranger: No… No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[Kratos lifts moaning Stranger from the ground.]

The Stranger: Fine. My turn.

[He hits Kratos with such force that he flies over his own house. The Stranger jumps after him.]

The Stranger: How incredibly disappointing. Come on then.

[They begin to fight. Kratos strikes the Stranger with his powerful axe, shield, and fists, but this does not seem to deal much damage. The Stranger doesn't even moan with pain.]

The Stranger: Pointless. You bore me. Are you even trying? Come on, already. So slow…

[The Stranger punches Kratos several brain strokes with ice fists. Kratos flies away to his house, landing on its roof. The Stranger jumps after him and starts choking Kratos.]

The Stranger: Tell me what I want… Pain stops. Real simple.

[He strikes at the head of Kratos and punches through the roof. Through a hole, he sees the inside of the house.]

The Stranger: Why are there two beds in there?

[Kratos manages to throw off the Stranger. He sits on top of him not allowing to move, and begins to take out his anger.]

Kratos: (beating the Stranger to death) LEAVE! MY! HOME!

[The Stranger manages to break out and throw Kratos to the ground.]

The Stranger: Struck a nerve, did I?!

[Kratos hits The Stranger with a huge trunk of a tree, runs to him, grabs him, and begins to knock down the debris of the house and stones on his way.]

The Stranger: Who are you hiding?! Slow and old. You should never have come to Midgard.

[The Stranger regenerates his health with ease.]

The Stranger: So… care to try again?

Kratos: You talk too much.

[They begin to fight on their fists. The Stranger throws Kratos with such force that he splits a giant stone with his body.]

The Stranger: You won’t talk? Fine. Maybe whoever it is you’ve got stashed in that house will.

[Hearing this, Kratos shouts in a Spartan rage, breaks the stone and grabs the Stranger. He breaks the thick trunk of the tree with the Stranger's head, pokes him with the trunk, and runs with him through the split in two stones.]

The Stranger: Who is it? Who are you afraid I’ll find?! Let’s find out!

[The fight continues.]

The Stranger: Pointless! What are you hiding? You still bore me. You’re a fool.

[Kratos eerily beats the Stranger, breaks a huge stone monument with his bare hands and falls on the Stranger. After that, tired and exhausted Kratos slowly walks away. However, the Stranger picks up a monument and throws Kratos. Kratos blocks with his shield, destroying the monument. Kratos clings with the Stranger. The rock under their feet destroys by the power they put into the struggle.]

The Stranger: Leaving so soon? When Odin sent me here, I just needed answers, but YOU, you had to act all proud. Throw whatever you have at me… I’ll keep coming. That old body will give out. But before I end this, I want you to know one thing… I can’t feel any of this.

[He punches Kratos into the air. They begin to fight in the air. The Stranger hits Kratos and he flies into a crack in the ground. Kratos stops his falling with the axe, which he stuck into the rock.]

The Stranger: You’ve seen it with your own eyes; you can’t hurt me. Nothing can. This fight is pointless. Your struggle is pointless. It didn’t have to be this way.

[Kratos gets out of the crack, but the Stranger kicks him to the other side. Kratos's strength is coming to an end.]

The Stranger: Pathetic. You can’t win. I feel nothing, but you… you feel everything. Yet you, you keep trying. I’m not my brother. (Kratos regenerates some of his health) And if you’d given me what I wanted, it wouldn’t have ended this way. But no…

[He flies to Kratos to strike a fatal blow, but Kratos dodges.]

The Stranger: Let’s finish this.

[The third phase of the fight begins.]

The Stranger: Can’t beat me! COME ON! I feel NOTHING! NOTHING! WORTHLESS! PITIFUL! I will end you!

[Kratos grabs the Stranger, throws him on the ground and begins to choke.]

The Stranger: I’d hoped that you, of everyone I’d faced, would finally make me feel something. But you can’t.

[Kratos snaps his neck and throws the body into the crack, after which he barely gets back on his feet and goes to the house.]

Kratos: Who was he? He knew me. Did he know my past? How did they find me… after all this time? Faye… what do I do? Our son is not ready… to carry your ashes… to the top of the mountain. And neither am I. I do not know… how to do this without you. But we cannot stay here…

[He enters his half destroyed house.]

Atreus: There was so much… I thought… You’re all right.

Kratos: I am all right. Come. Gather your things. We are leaving.

Atreus: Thought I wasn’t ready.

Kratos: You are not. But we have no choice now. Prove me wrong.

Atreus: Yes, sir.

[They leave the house.]

Atreus: The mountain… it’s gonna be a LONG trip.

Kratos: Yes. But an important one.

[“THE MARKED TREES” COMPLETED.]

PATH TO THE MOUNTAIN
Journey to the Mountain
Atreus: Whoa… how did this happen? Who was he?

Kratos: I do not know.

Atreus: What did he want with us? We’re nobodies. Did you kill him?

Kratos: I did what had to be done.

Atreus: You could have died. Never have me alone again. All right?

Kratos: All right. Up.

Atreus: You’ve had to kill people before, haven’t you? You’re used to it.

Kratos: We do what we must to survive.

Atreus: Animals, I get. They’re food. Draugr… they’re supposed to be dead. But people… they’re trying to survive too.

Kratos: Close your heart to it. On our journey, we will be attacked by all manner of creature. Close your heart to their desperation. Close your heart to their suffering. Do not allow yourself to feel for them. They will not feel for you.

Atreus: I understand.

[They climb into a cave, in which they find an elevator.]

Atreus: Has this been here all this time? Why don’t you help me up there? I can get a better look. Hop!

[Kratos boosts Atreus up.]

Atreus: Okay… nowhere to go from here… except across this bridge. Think you can lower it from there?

[Kratos lowers the bridge.]

Kratos: Go.

Atreus: Made it!

Kratos: Boy…

Atreus: Yes, sir.

[Kratos freezes the cog of the bridge and climbs up.]

Atreus: Good idea… This way. I think. Father… will we see others on the road?

Kratos: Yes.

Atreus: Friendly?

Kratos: No.

Atreus: They’ll try and rob us?

Kratos: Possibly. Yes.

[They climb to the top. Atreus notices a stunning view of wild and unspoiled nature…]

Atreus: Look… All this time… there’s been a protection stave around our entire woods. But… the stave’s broken there. Did you cut those down?

Kratos: She hand-marked the trees she wished used for her pyre…

Atreus: Why’d she do that?

Kratos: Come. No looking back now.

Atreus: So… how long will it take to get to the mountain?

Kratos: I do not know.

Atreus: Before winter falls?

Kratos: I do not know…

Atreus: Okay, okay…

[They reach Wildwood’s Edge and find some draugr in a small field.]

Atreus: They don’t see us. Should I fire?

Kratos: Wait for my mark.

Atreus: More draugr! Draugr down! Watch out, Father! One less draugr to worry about! Right flank! More draugr! Whoah, this one throws fire! How does he do that?!

Kratos: BOY! Focus. Look alive, boy!

Atreus: I see them! Fire, incoming!

Kratos: More enemies, boy!

Atreus: Yes, sir! Father! When is this gonna end! Another one down! Amazing! Keep the pressure on. Careful! Look out!

[After defeating all draugr…]

Atreus: How was that? Did I help?

Kratos: If you want to help, distract them. Whoever is not my focus should be yours… but only when safe to do so.

Atreus: I can do that.

[Kratos find a stone nearby with writings on it.]

Kratos: Boy.

Atreus: Sir. There’s a Jotnar settlement ahead…

Kratos: Jotnar?

Atreus: Giants.

Kratos: You can read the writing?

Atreus: Some -- just the languages mother knew. But they’re all sort of connected so sometimes I can feel my way through stuff I shouldn’t know. Y’know?

[They climb up the mountain. Atreus stumbles upon some agile draugr.]

Atreus: AAH! I’m set! Anything else?

Kratos: Space your shots. Speed costs accuracy.

Atreus: Got it. Hey… I think there’s a chest over there!

[Kratos opens a chest and finds his first rune. He's trying to use it right away.]

Atreus: Whoa! How’d you do that?! I think we can go through here.

Kratos: (lifting giant stone) Move.

Atreus: Thanks. There’s the mountain! Let’s go! (runs away)

Kratos: Not yet!

[Atreus runs to a bridge to the mountain.]

Atreus: It’s fine!

[He jumps on the bridge and one of the planks cracks]

Atreus: Aaah! Father, help!

Kratos: Hang on!

Atreus: Hurry! I’m slipping!

Kratos: Hang on! Stay calm.

Atreus: Aaah!

[They both fall.]

Atreus: Huh… that wasn’t so bad.

Kratos: SLOW DOWN. Your haste will cost us.

Atreus: Sorry…

[Around our heroes are a lot of draugrs standing still…]

Atreus: Uh… more Draugr. But these aren’t moving. Are they dead? I mean… more dead?

Kratos: (getting the axe) Boooy…

Atreus: Not dead! Not dead!

Kratos: Remember: Accuracy over speed!

Atreus: Look out Father! That Draugr’s injured, get him! On your right, incoming fire! Yeah, take that! You don’t look so great! Fire, above us! One more to go! That was the last one. Was I better?

Kratos: Take even more time. It does not matter if you fire only once. Show me control.

Escape the Ruins
[In the far corner of the dilapidated room, Atreus notices a lengthy stone with runes written on it that glows blue light.]

Atreus: Look at this…

Kratos: Read it.

Atreus: Oh. This used to be a marketplace. The Giants used to gather here to trade with the gods a long time ago. Wonder if Odin was ever here… Look — above us! Something’s breaking through! Something’s breaking through the wall!

[From behind the wall, to which the chip of the column is leaning, deaf blows are heard. Something incredibly strong is trying to break through the wall. The chip of the column with a rumble falls off from the wall and a large draugr with an axe jumps out furiously towards the heroes.]

Atreus: Draugr! I can’t get free! I need help! Father, I need you! He’s got me, help! Tell me when… Nista! Watch out! Look out Father! Need more time. Ready and waiting. Sorry, not ready. I’m exhausted. Look — there’s an opening up there.

[Having defeated all enemies, Kratos climbs the wall. Atreus jumps on his back.]

Atreus: Uh… do you hear that? What is it?

Kratos: We will see. Stay close.

Atreus: What is that? So we’re going towards the scary singing? It’s a Revenant!! Watch ‘em! Poison! I’m ready. She just disappeared?! Nista! Poison, incoming! She’s too fast for your axe!

Kratos: But not for your arrows! Fire!

Atreus: Nista! Watch out Father! That was a real Revenant! Never thought I’d see one up close…

[Having defeated the evil ghost Kratos climbs further.]

Atreus: I still don’t understand why that man attacked you at our house.

Kratos: I told you, boy. I know nothing more of it.

Atreus: Look up there! I guess we need to get back up there. But how?

Kratos: Follow me.

[]

Kratos: Boy.

Atreus: I’ve seen this language before…

[]

Kratos: Here, boy, another one.

Atreus: It says his name is “Hrungnir”. Mother told me about him… a Giant warrior, made of stone. Looks like he was in a pretty big battle… Odin’s there… Thor… even the World Serpent? Aw, Thor must have smashed his head apart, see? But look. Hrungnir’s body squished him. Idiot…

[]

Atreus: Earlier… you said people might try and rob us. I’ll kill them if they try. I’m not afraid.

Kratos: If we encounter men, you will stay out of it, understand?

Atreus: But… I can fight now.

Kratos: You will stay out of it, boy. Speak no more of this. Atreus, follow me.

Atreus: Sorry, I got distracted.

[]

Atreus: Grab that one, Father! You’re kinda scary sometimes!

[The fight was fierce but Kratos manages to overcome his enemies.]

Atreus: Thought they almost had us.

Kratos: We must stay vigilant.

Atreus: You did it.

[They cross the bridge and find mountains of corpses on the other side.]

Atreus: All these dead… you think it’s safe in there?

Kratos: You think it safer out here?

Atreus: Echh… What’s that smell?

???: NOW!!

[The door behind the heroes slams shut. A group of men surrounds Kratos and Atreus.]

Man 1: Are they Hel-Walkers?

Man 2: They’re untouched! Look!

Man 3: Someone start the fires!

Man 2: Siegmund, your mas!

Man 4: So many days… Without meat.

Atreus: Meat? Wait - us?

Kratos: Behind me.

Man 3: What if they change like the others?

Man 1: We’ll have to keep them alive. Strip off their meat… a little at a time.

Kratos: This fight is mine alone.

[Kratos pulls out his axe. Being ordinary people, the enemies are no threat to him.]

Man 1: He wields magic!

Man 2: He’s just one man! Wait for an opening!

[Having hacked most of the cannibals, Kratos enthusiastically chokes one of them. At this time, Atreus is trying to fend off the last of the cannibals.]

Atreus: Father! Help me!

Kratos: Atreus!

[Kratos runs up to him, but Atreus stabs the cannibal with his mother’s knife at the last moment.]

Atreus: (breathing efforts)

Kratos: Close your heart to it. Come then.

Kratos: We have a long journey ahead -

[The cannibals turn into walkers.]

Kratos: Wait here. I will handle this.

[He crushes the walkers with his own hands.]

Atreus: Th-They came back.

Kratos: It is finished.

Atreus: I want to leave here.

Kratos: We must find a way out. Find something to pull me up.

Atreus: Okay.

[Atreus slowly goes to the chain, immersed in sad thoughts.]

Kratos: Atreus… the chain.

Atreus: The chain, right.

Kratos: You are in your head, boy. Let it go. He would have killed you.

Atreus: I know. I had to do it. I do know that. I just…

Kratos: Then we will go home, boy.

Atreus: What?

Kratos: To give up this easily, so close to the start…

[Atrey instantly comes to his senses and runs to the chain.]

Atreus: I’m not giving up. I can do this. I just have to… you know… catch my breath. Come on up. I’m ready.

Kratos: Listen to me… To be effective in combat, a warrior must not feel for his enemy. The road ahead is long and unforgiving… no place for a boy. You must be a warrior.

Atreus: I understand.

The Dwarf And His Creature
[They hear someone swearing from afar…]

???: Get up and move your ass! I’ll kick you square in the ringer you don’t move! C’moooooon! Whatcha waitin’ for? C’mon already! LET’S GO! Whatcha waitin’ for? C’mon already! Let’s go! Grrrrrahhhh!

[They find a dwarf trying to force his… uh, elephant… to cross the bridge.]

Dwarf: Can’t get this sloe-eyed cocklump to cross the bridge! Hrmph!

Atreus: It’s because she’s scared of something in the trees over there.

Dwarf: There’s what now?

Atreus: Father, throw your axe at those trees on the other side of the bridge - the ones with the white trunks.

[Kratos reluctantly fulfills the request.]

Kratos: You were right…

Dwarf: Hey… you must be smart or somethin’, boy. You are a boy aren’tcha? (slaps the elephant) HAAA!

Atreus: She have a name?

Dwarf: I dunno. Rude bastard ain’t ever asked mine so I ain’t ever asked hers. HAAA!!

Atreus: What’s yours?

Dwarf: Brok.

Atreus: (to the elephant) Vera logn…

[The elephant begins to walk slowly.]

Brok: (to Kratos) Say… you’re not gonna believe me but uh… that axe you got, uh? It was me what made her - me and my brother. Was one of our best. So don’t let nobody else go work on her except for us two. (the elephant slaps him with her tail) AAACH! You gotta handle her special or she’ll wreck beyond fixin’. I can enhance her for you right now if it so pleases you son of bitch. So what say you? (slaps the elephant) HAA!

Kratos: You are right… I do not believe you. Come, boy.

Brok: There’s a rune in the shape of a fork - under the grip.

[Kratos checks the axe.]

Brok: (to the elephant) Aw… digr bikkja! Dumbr bak-rauf! (to Kratos) That was our brand my brother and me, before we split. I got half of it right here – see? Look, you want upgrade her or not?

Kratos: Very well. I expect an improvement.

Atreus: So where’s the other half of the brand?

Brok: Oh, my dumb brother’s got it. But I got all the talent. Look! Let’s get to it! Try that on for size… What’s it gonna be? Make you something? See if that don’t shoot straighter than straight… Oh, you make up yer mind?

[He upgrades the axe and sells some equipment.]

Brok: Well, don’t look now but our friends who were hiding in the trees are back for more! Go on, give that axe a twirl!

Atreus: Got room for me behind there?

Brok: So long as you don’t break nothing.

[Kratos tries the upgrade killing some zombies nearby.]

Brok: Y’see?! See what my touch brung? Say your pa can KILL. You gonna learn to do that too?

Atreus: I’m not sure…

Kratos: This road… it leads to the mountain?

Brok: Should put you in the right direction, sure. Wanna see my wares again?

[Kratos and Atreus continue their journey.]

Kratos: You left me to fight alone.

Atreus: I did.

Kratos: People are one thing. Everything else, you fight… until I say stop or we are dead. Understand? Pull your weight or we go home.

Atreus: I understand.

Kratos: Good then.

Atreus: Oh, wait… we’re back here again.

Kratos: Come.

Atreus: It was nice meeting you, Brok. I’ll be thinking of a name for your beast.

Brok: How ‘bout I name her “fucking gratitude”? Hey! Fucking Gratitude - come over here! I like it!

[Kratos decides to buy some new equipment one last time.]

Brok: Alright, what’dja break? Good to see you sweatin’ the details. Wear it proudly ya sumbitch! Was that all there is…? Hey watch your ‘hinds in there! That place can bust you up real good.

Atreus: Uh…

Kratos: This way.

The Hunt Continues
Atreus: Uh… that looks inviting. Oooh…

Kratos: Wait there.

Atreus: Sure are a lot of draugr around here! Careful! Take that, draugr! Watch out Father! Nista! I’m ready. Fire, incoming! Enemy down! Ready, father. Wow! I’m set.

Kratos: Atreus, here.

Atreus: Yes, father. It’s sinking back down!

Kratos: Now, boy!

Atreus: Coming! Wasn’t sure we were gonna get outta there…

Kratos: Trust I will not let us die. This way.

[They come out of the caves and see a stunning view of wild mountain nature.]

Atreus: Wow… Never been this close to the mountain before. Looks so big. I wish Mom was here to see it.

[Kratos wants to hug his son but stops.]

Kratos: Come, boy.

[They find a grand door with a bowl of sand nears it.]

Atreus: What is it…? Look. There are runes written along the side.

Kratos: What does it say?

Atreus: “As we are, we two, we three / As I alone can never be.”

Kratos: A riddle?

Atreus: Hmmm… maybe there’s a clue around here. Seems like maybe those rings should be moving. The rings are turning! Conic back down. I think that part’s right. That’s it! I see runes!

Kratos: Boy, what do those runes say?

Atreus: Oooh… It says “Family”. That’s not a clue. It’s the answer! What “I alone can never be” - right?

Kratos: Use your knife and trace the runes into the sand.

Atreus: Really? Kynslóð. Something happening! It worked! I’m happy we met Brok… but… I’m happier we’re leaving this place…

Kratos: It is behind us now. Boy… These tracks…

Atreus: Mm… a boar maybe? Not sure. But I’ll find it.

Kratos: It is important for a warrior to keep his skills sharp.

[They stumble upon a troll Brenna Dauði (Burning Death)]

Atreus: Woah!

Kratos: Focus up!

Atreus: Nista! Fire on your right. I’m ready. I’m set.

Kratos: Get back, boy.

Atreus: Need more time. All set. Whoah!

[Kratos and Atreus manage to defeat this monster.]

Atreus: Phew… I’m outta breath.

[For the victory over the troll, Kratos gets a chest… but it's locked.]

Kratos: Here. What does it say?

Atreus: The runes symbolise three Nornir.

Kratos: Nornir?

Atreus: The fates.

Kratos: The fates. No good comes from them.

Atreus: Okay…

[Kratos rings three bells with runes on them.]

Atreus: We can open the chest now!

Kratos: Boy… I hear your animal ahead. Shoot when you are ready. Remember… draw to your chest. A wild boar hide is thick.

[Atreus shoots strictly following the instructions of Kratos.]

Atreus: But… I hit it. Didn’t I? I did what you said and it looked like it bounced off. Could the boar be magical?

Kratos: Hunh. What do you think?

Atreus: It looked weirder than any boar I’ve ever seen…

Kratos: Get after it then. Stay alert.

[They find a routed camp.]

Atreus: More of those people?

Kratos: Something else.

Atreus: Some of the bodies are those weird dead things. There’s Draugr here too. They must have been fighting?

[At the end of the camp Kratos sees a giant piece of column barricading the path.]

Kratos: Here. It run under.

Atreus: I got it. Elbow up. Steady hand. Relax… accuracy over speed… YES!

[He hit the boar but it ran away.]

Kratos: Do not lose it.

Witch of the Woods
[Rejoicing at luck, Atreus runs after the boar, losing his mother’s knife in haste. Kratos picks it up, grumbles and runs after his son. Everything around is suddenly clouded by fog.]

Kratos: Boy! Where are you?

Atreus: Hurry father! I found him!

Kratos: Atreus!

Atreus: He’s slowing down!

Kratos: Wait for me, boy!

Atreus: Father, over here!

Kratos: Atreus?! Where are you?

Woman’s Voice: WHAT DID YOU DO!?!

Atreus: I’m sorry!

Kratos: ATREUS!!

[He starts to run as fast as he can. Getting out on a small clearing, he sees a woman and Atreus. A woman is trying to heal the boar.]

Atreus: We didn’t know he belonged to anyone.

Woman: He doesn’t. He’s my friend.

Kratos: The boy was following my command.

Woman: Then help fix this. Hold here lease. HOLD, I said. He’s losing blood. The last of his kind in all the realm and you shoot him. You needed food?

Atreus: Target practice…

Woman: Target practice…

Atreus: I’m so so sorry…

Woman: Keep that pressure on. The blame is mine. I should have kept a closer eye.

Atreus: Will he die?

Woman: I will not let him. You - the arrow cut a tideway inside him. Find both ends and hold them tightly. Start with the left side. Grab it and hold. Now the right side. Hold it tight. Good. Now pull them together - line them up. Sunnan- þoka.

Atreus: You’re a witch…

Witch: I can’t finish the healing here. My home is just beyond the trees there. You’ll carry him? He must not die. Good. He seems stable and aim for now. Greiða! This way. (to Atreus) That bow’s a little big for you. Isn’t it?

Atreus: My mother made it for me. Said I’d grow into it.

Witch: I’ve never seen you in these woods. She must miss you being away from home.

Atreus: She… she’s dead. We’re taking her ashes to the highest peak in the realms.

Witch: Ashes?

Atreus: It was her last wish.

Kratos: Boy!

Witch: I’m… sorry for your loss. We’re here.

Atreus: You live in a tree?

Witch: Not in it - below it. Heimili (Home)!

Atreus: Look!

[Giant turtle digs up with a tree on its back.]

Witch: It’s alright.

Atreus: Is he friendly?!

Witch: I promise you he’s safe. He won’t hurt anyone…

Kratos: Boy…

[The witch opens the door and Kratos brings the boar inside.]

Witch: Quickly. Place him on the stave there. Keep him still.

Atreus: You live alone?

Witch: It’s better this way.

Atreus: Yeah, my father doesn’t like people either.

Kratos: Boy.

Atreus: Well, you don’t.

Witch: Hold him still - before he hurts himself. Good. Easy… rest now… I need two more things. Fresh red root grows just behind the house. Can you pull a cluster?

[Atreus looks at Kratos. He nods. Atreus leaves the house.]

Kratos: What else?

Witch: I… I know you’re a god. Not of this realm, but there’s no mistaking it. He doesn’t know, does he? About your true nature - or his own?

Kratos: That is none of your concern.

Witch: The gods of these realms don’t take kindly to outsiders. Trust me, I know. When they find you - and they will - they’ll make things difficult. The boy will want answers.

Kratos: That will be my problem.

Witch: Whatever you’re hiding, you cannot protect him forever.

Witch: But you’re right… doesn’t concern me. I also need Lamb’s Cress. Do you mind? It’s a white-petalled flower in my garden, just a handful.

Kratos: Lambs Cress…

[He leaves the house.]

Atreus: I like her. I mean, she lives under a turtle!

Kratos: You are too open with her. We do not know if she can be trusted.

Atreus: She hasn’t tried to kill us.

Kratos: Yet.

[Kratos gathers flowers and returns to Atreus. He tries to pull the root out of the ground.]

Atreus: Can you help? I can’t quite get it.

Kratos: Would this help?

Atreus: I dropped it…?

Kratos: When you were chasing the animal.

Atreus: What’s wrong with me? If I’d lost it…

Kratos: You did lose it.

Atreus: I’ll take better care of it from now on.

[They return to the Witch.]

Witch: Ah, exactly what I need.

Atreus: So he’s going to live?

Witch: Yes.

Kratos: When we are leaving.

Witch: Wait… Not without thanks.

[A witch dunks her fingers into some kind of salve. Kratos quickly grabs her hand.]

Witch: You want solitude? This mark will hide you from those who might make your journey… difficult.

[Looking threateningly at the witch, Kratos lets her smear his neck.]

Witch: Leyna (Disguise).

[She also smears Atreus’ neck.]

Witch: Leyna (Disguise). Heimili (Home)! There is a shortcut below the house that leads safely out of these woods. Follow this path down, then head towards daylight.

Atreus: Will we see you again?

Witch: As much or as little as you like. Now get out of here.

Kratos: Come, boy.

Witch: This underground passage should put you back on your path to the mountain. Just use the boat. And take this… You can use it to orient yourself and navigate the world. It will always steer you towards your goals.

Atreus: I see a boat. Nightmares! Nista! Above you, look out! I’m ready. Nightmares… Mom used to tell me about them. Didn’t think they were actually real.

Kratos: Nightmares?

Atreus: They give people nightmares. Or they ARE nightmares? I don’t remember which. I wish I could ask her.

[Kratos moves a giant block of solid stone.]

Atreus: Isn’t that heavy? Doesn’t seem heavy…

Kratos: Do not touch the water.

Atreus: Why?

Kratos: Do you know what is under the surface?

Atreus: No, it’s pitch black.

Kratos: When do not touch the water. Over there!
